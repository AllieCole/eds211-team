# Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

-   **Create `notebook` Repo in Github Organization**. Create a new Github organization based on your Project Key (e.g. `ohi-science`) and fork the template from Dr Stevenson there.

# Setup Final Project Notebook Repo in New Github Organization

The Github Organization you create will become the `{owner}` of the project's main `{repo}`. Remember, all of Github is organized according to `github.com/{owner}/{repo}`.

You will then **fork** the template repo [samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom](https://github.com/samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom) where `{owner}` = `samanthastevenson` into your new Github organization (e.g. `{owner}` = `ohi-science` from Project Key of [EDS 211 - Lab 1. Proposal](https://bbest.github.io/eds211-team/lab1_proposal.html#create-group-project-key-and-title)).

## Create Github Organization (lead only)

Have only one group project member follow instructions to [Create a new organization from scratch - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch). Even more simply, choose **+** and **New organization** from upper right of [github.com](https://github.com) once you're logged in:

![](img/lab3_github/github_new-org.jpg){style="width:150px;"}

-   **Organization account name**:\
    This should be your Project Key from [EDS 211 - Lab 1. Proposal](https://bbest.github.io/eds211-team/lab1_proposal.html#create-group-project-key-and-title), e.g. `ohi-science`).

-   **Contact email**:\
    This should be the email associated with your Github account.

-   **This organization belongs to**:\
    Choose ***My personal account***.

-   **Add organization members**:\
    Add the Github usernames of the rest of your **team** plus instructors for both classes:

    -   `samanthastevenson` (EDS 220)
    -   `bbest` (EDS 211).

-   **What do you spend time on most day-to-day?**\
    I chose: Writing code and Planning projects.

-   **How many people do you expect to actively work within this GitHub organization?\
    **1 -5

-   **What type of work do you plan to use this organization for?\
    **Education projects

-   **What do you expect to do on GitHub in the next seven days?\
    **Collaborate on code; Plan and track work; Set up CI/CD \
    [[Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) / [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) such as Github Action to automatically render Rmarkdown to html on website.]

-   **Do you have an existing repository for your project?\
    **No

## Edit All Invited People to make Owner (lead), Accept invitations (all)

Now the lead needs to visit the **People** tab of the organization, visit **Pending invitations** and make everyone an **Owner** (gear icon, Edit invitation, Owner, Update invitation).

All the rest of the team members need to accept the invitations, which can be done by directly visiting `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/invitations`.

## Fork `samanthastevenson/{repo}` into `{org}/{repo}` (lead only)

[Fork the repo - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo):

-   **From**: `samanthastevenson/{repo}` <br> The template repository [samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom](https://github.com/samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom) that Dr. Stevenson created for your Remote Sensing (EDS 220) group project.
-   **To**: `{org}/{repo}` <br> The organization should be what you created in the previous step. You can rename the repo from `EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom` to something shorter like `notebook`.
