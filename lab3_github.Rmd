# Learning Objectives {.unnumbered}

-   **Create Repos in Github Organization**. Create a new Github organization based on your Project Key (e.g. `ohi-science`).

# Setup Final Project in New Github Organization

The Github Organization you create will become the `{owner}` of the project's main `{repo}`. Remember, all of Github is organized according to `github.com/{owner}/{repo}`.

You will then **fork** the template repo [samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom](https://github.com/samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom) where `{owner}` = `samanthastevenson` into your new Github organization (e.g. `ohi-science` from Project Key of [EDS 211 - Lab 1. Proposal](https://bbest.github.io/eds211-team/lab1_proposal.html#create-group-project-key-and-title)).

## Create Github Organization (lead only)

Have only one group project member follow instructions to [Create a new organization from scratch - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch). Even more simply, choose **+** and **New organization** from upper right of [github.com](https://github.com) once you're logged in:

## Fork `samanthastevenson/{repo}` into `{org}/{repo}` (lead only)

[Fork the repo - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo):

- **From**: `samanthastevenson/{repo}` <br>
  The template repository [samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom](https://github.com/samanthastevenson/EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom) that Dr. Stevenson created for your Remote Sensing (EDS 220) group project.
-   **To**: `{org}/{repo}` <br>
  The organization should be what you created in the previous step. You can rename the repo from `EDS220_Fall2021_FinalProjInfofrom` to something shorter like `notebook`.
