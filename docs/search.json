In this class you’ll learn how to work together on code while managing a project. You’ll apply these techniques to the group project from the course Remote Sensing (EDS 220) and they should help you manage your Capstone group project starting winter quarter. The techniques will help guide three basic questions:\nWhat should I work on next?\nHow long will it take?\nHow do we adapt to change?\nThese basic questions are however deceptively difficult to answer, especially as the size of the team and scope of the project increases.\nWhat should I work on next? You’ll learn ‘agile’ software development techniques to divide work into tasks, which can be assigned to various team members and passed between as work progresses. These tasks can be arranged as cards into columns on a ‘Kanban’ board: horizontally according to status (ToDo, In Progress, Done) or time (next week, next month, …); and vertically based on priority (from most to least important, top to bottom). This overview of who is to do what next will be approached with different tools embracing increasing levels of complexity: a Trello board for basic projects without code, a Github Project to integrate Github Issues associated with code level git commit messages, and ZenHub for adding dependencies between issues and clustering into Epics for use with Roadmaps.\nHow long will it take? You’ll take on the role of an environmental data science consultancy responding to a request for proposal. In the proposal you’ll outline milestones with deliverables and associated dollar amounts based on time estimates and hourly rates of team members. You’ll track time spent on each task and report out at the end with a presentation on time spent over and under expectations, which will help update your understanding for future estimates. You’ll use Clockify to track time and Rmarkdown to generate reports.\nHow do we adapt to change? Changes are inevitable with technical problem solving and client requirements. As Mark Zuckerberg famously said “move fast and break things.” Iterating quickly within the team and getting feedback from all stakeholders are an important part of the development process and the basis for ‘agile’ project management. You’ll compare ‘traditional’ project management with scoping tasks at the outset of the project with a Gantt chart as a ‘waterfall’ diagram showing various phases of the project (eg data collection, analysis and communication). As you proceed with the project you’ll keep track of tasks that expand and shift with some evaluation after the fact through a burndown report. Other ‘agile’ techniques and roles will be reviewed to adapt to change.\n3 Office Hours\nOffice Hours are Mondays 1-2pm at NCEAS. You can swing by the office across from Jamie’s where I’ll be or better yet slot 10 minutes in advance with this calendar:\nAppointment Calendar for Ben’s Office Hours\n4 Grading\nGrades will be based on the following percentages:\nAttendance: 10%\nLabs: 60%\nPresentation: 30%\n5 Readings\n\n\nshow\n\nlibrary(citr)\nmd_cite(\"Bennett\", bib_file=\"eds211-team.bib\")\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1: Bennett and Gadlin (2012) (pdf)\nWeek 2: Lowndes et al.

Use Google Docs to keep quick flexible notes as you proceed with meetings using headers and table of contents.\nTasks. Break down your project into tasks.\nSchedule of Tasks. Create a simple schedule in Google Sheets using cells as units of time. Create a detailed Google Chart pulling from specific dates in a Google Sheet.\nSchedule of Deliverables. Create a table of deliverables with due date and amount based on schedule of tasks, estimated hours and an hourly rate.\nRFP and Proposal. Write a simple Request for Proposal and a responding Proposal with core elements for submission.\n1 Create Group Project Key and Title\n\nThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.\n— Phil Karlton (Netscape “Principal Curmudgeon”; 1947-1997)\n\nThink carefully about what you’d like to call your group project. Come up with:\nTitle\ncamel case, with spaces\nFor instance, “Ocean Health Index.”\nKey\nall lower case, no spaces, possibly an acronym\nFor instance, “ohi.” Ideally, find a key that is not already taken on Github. Since github.com/ohi is already taken, we chose “ohi-science” as the final key. You don’t need to create a new Github organization just yet. We’ll handle that in the Github lab.\n2 Take Notes in Google Docs\nHave one of your project members create a folder named after the project’s key name in Google Drive. Share this folder with all members and the instructor (ben@ecoquants.com).\nAdd a Google Document named “notes | {key}” (swapping out {key} with your project’s Key). (Note that adding the extra project key to the document name makes it show up in the browser tab, which differentiates it from other tabs with documents named simply “notes.”) Add the same name to the top of the document formatted as Title. Add Meetings formatted as Heading 1 and below that today’s date in YYYY-MM-DD format as Heading 2. Between the title and first header add normal text “Contents:” and below that add Table of Contents. For reference, see: Add a title, heading, or table of contents in a document - Computer - Docs Editors Help. Start the first bullet point. Your document should look similar to this:\n3 Consider Tasks of your Project\nNow consider the various Tasks of your project, such as: data acquisition, information extraction and cleaning, data integration, modeling, analysis, interpretation and deployment (Larson (2019)). Try to be as specific as you can. Write these down in your notes as a numbered list.\nData science workflow showing Tasks of development with iteration. Source: Wickham and Grolemund (2017)4 Create Simple Project Schedule\nYour first Gantt chart will simply use cells horizontally as time.\nCreate a new Google Sheet in your project Drive folder named “schedule | {key}” (swapping out {key} with your project’s Key). Name the tab “simple.”\nAdd columns “Task,” dates “Nov 1,” “Nov 8.” Select “Nov 1” and “Nov 8” cells, then click the lower right blue box to drag and fill values to the end of the quarter, “Dec 6.”\nFill out the Tasks column with those specific to your project.\nMake the cell background gray for the estimated work period for each of the Tasks, whereby the start day is given by the column’s date.\nMake the column headers bold and add border lines below the header and to the right of the Task column.\nYou simple Gantt chart should look similar to this:\n\n5 Create Detailed Project Schedule\nFor more complex projects, you might want to display the project schedule with specific dates over time. To do this you’ll create a Google Chart from Task data using dates.\nCreate a new tab called “detailed” in the same “schedule | {key}” Google Sheet. Copy the “Task” column from your “simple” tab to this new one.\nAdd columns “Start Date” and “End Date.” Fill out these dates per Task.\nAdd columns “Start Day” and “Duration.” Calculate the first of these fields according to the dates and fill down values for all Tasks:\nStart Day: =int(B2)-int($B$2). This represents the number of days from the beginning of the project $B$2 that the task starts. Notice how the dollar prefixes for cell $B$2 continue to use the same fixed cell as values get filled down (vs B2 changing to C2, D2, etc.).\nDuration: =int(C2)-int(B2). This represents the number of days for each task.\n\nMove “Start Date” and “End Date” columns to the right of “Start Day” and “Duration.”\nSelect all cells within the “Task,” “Start Day” and “Duration” columns including the headers. From the menu, choose Insert -> Chart. It will default to a “Stacked bar chart.”\nConfigure the chart. In the Chart editor panel on the right, click the Customize tab. Click Series, then click the dropdown menu and Start Day. Enter 0% for Fill opacity to turn off display of this Series. The chart should now resemble a Gantt chart.\nUpdate the Chart and Axis Titles. Double-click on the title at the top of the chart. Type new title “Project Schedule.” Customize the Chart & axis titles so the Horizontal axis title has “Day” for Title text.\nRemove the Chart Legend. Click on the chart and three circles in upper right, Edit chart. Click the Customize tab in the Chart editor panel, then click Legend. Select Position: None.\nIn the end, you should have a chart like so:\n\n6 Create Schedule of Deliverables\nCreate a new tab called “deliverables” in your “schedule | {key}” Google Sheet.\nAdd columns: Deliverable | Date Due | Amount | Hours | Hourly Rate. Make the first 3 column headers (Deliverable | Date Due | Amount) bold and add an underline to be used in the final table, whereas the Hours and Hourly Rate columns are only used to calculate the Amount.\nPopulate the Deliverables and Date Due cells base on outputs from the schedule of Tasks.\nEnter the Hourly Rate of $100 and estimate the number of hours it will take to complete each task here described as deliverables.\nEnter the first cell for the Amount using the equation =D2*$E$2 and fill down:\n7 Write the RFP\nCreate a Google Document simply named RFP (Request for Proposal) with your project key, so “rfp | {key}.” Give it a title summarizing the desired output product and a new line below that with “Request for Proposal” formatted as a Subtitle. Imagine you are the client seeking the analytic output of your Remote Sensing group project. Write one paragraph describing this as a request to solicit bids from environmental data science consultancies.\n8 Write the Proposal\nCreate a Google Document named “proposal | {key}.” This is your environmental data science consultancy’s response to the RFP bidding for the work.\nInclude in your proposal:\nTitle same as RFP with subtitle Proposal.\nDate in the upper right.\nContents with Table of Contents added, similar to Notes. Be sure to refresh the Table of Contents after you add the headers below.\nOverview. Below a Heading 1 of Overview, describe the project summarizing or expanding upon the RFP in a paragraph.\nSchedule of Deliverables. Paste your schedule of deliverables below a Heading 1 of “Schedule of Deliverables.”\nWork Schedule. Include a detailed chart below a Heading 1 of “Work Schedule.” Optional: Expand on each of the tasks with more details in paragraph form below the chart.\nTeam. Below a Heading 1 of Team, provide a bulleted list of each team member with First Last (UCSB email address) and a one sentence description of relevant experience. Provide the rate for each team member as $100/hour.\n9 Submit Lab via Form\nEvery team member must submit links to the lab outputs via the following Google Form using your UCSB email:\nSubmission for Lab 1.

Time can be tracked in a simple spreadsheet, e.g. with columns: date, duration (hours), project, task and description. Even easier would be the ability to click a timer on and off with the ability to select project and task from a drop-down list and enter a textual description. For this timer app, we’ll use clockify.me with the many features described in the time lecture.\nSetup Project, Tasks, Team. Setup your project with tasks, including estimated time, and team members.\nEnter Time Manually or with Timer. Use any of the Clockify apps (web / browser extension / mobile app) to start and stop the timer, or enter time manually. Select the Project and Task before entering Description and possibly adding a Tag.\nGenerate Project Reports. Track progress of time spent on tasks, especially relative to initial estimate. Generate Summary and Detailed reports for your project based on day, team member, task, tag, etc.\nUse the API with an R package. A simple table of time entries can be extracted using Clockify’s application programming interface (API), which is easy to access with the R package clockify.\nBuild Personal Website of Time Tracked. Create a website using Github Pages from an Rmarkdown document in a new Github repository for reporting your time. The idea is for you to flexibly manipulate the data for your reporting needs rather than rely on Clockify’s interfaces.\n1 Setup Clockify\n1.1 Login with UCSB Account\nVisit clockify.me and click on GO TO TRACKER in upper right. Login with your UCSB Google account.\n1.2 Create Project, Tasks (lead only)\nChoose a team leader to enter a new Project with Tasks you previously entered in the detailed Schedule from Lab 1. Proposal. Be sure to have only a single project member enter this once to avoid duplication of projects (with different identifiers but possibly the same name) once you subsequently invite team members.\nCreate a project on the Project page per * Managing projects and clients – Clockify Help. Set the billable rate to $100 per hour.\n\n1.3 Invite Team Members (lead only)\nAdd Team Members using UCSB emails, per Inviting and managing users – Clockify Help.\n\n1.4 Install Extra Software\nInstall the Desktop app, Browser Extension and optionally Mobile app from clockify.me/apps.\n2 Enter Time\n2.1 Manually (past) and with Timer (present) per Project Task\nNow that you have Clockify setup for you and your Project, you’re ready to track time. Use the website or installed apps to track time by creating entries with Descriptions that include the letters #testing (so we can filter out these bogus entries later):\nAdd time entries for EACH project Task both:\nManually for last month of October in the past; and with\nTimer for a few seconds in the present.\n\n\n3 Create Summary Report\nBy User (lead only)\nNow create a Summary Report per Team Member for October & November, per Summary report – Clockify Help.\n\nBe sure to share the report publicly, per Sharing reports – Clockify Help. All team members will submit this URL for the lab.\n\n4 Create Personal Time Tracking Website\n4.1 Create Personal Github Repo\nCreate a Github repository called time in your Github user space (e.g. github.com/bbest/time for me), per Create a repo - GitHub Docs.\n4.2 Clone to Desktop\nFrom RStudio, clone the GitHub repository to your computer as a new Project, per Chapter 12 Connect RStudio to Git and GitHub | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR.\n\n4.3 Save Clockify API Key outside Repo\nVisit your Profile settings (clockify.me/user/settings) and record your private API key into a text file on your computer (e.g. ~/private/clockify_api-key.txt), but outside your publicly accessible Github repository.\n4.4 Create index.Rmd\nInclude the following R chunk:\n\n\nshow\n\n# get libraries\nif (!require(librarian)){\n  install.packages(\"librarian\")\n  library(librarian)\n}\nlibrarian::shelf(\n  clockify, dplyr, DT, glue, lubridate, readr)\n\n# CHANGE THESE VARIABLES!\napi_txt <- \"~/private/clockify_api-key.txt\"\napi_txt <- \"~/My Drive (ben@ecoquants.com)/private/clockify-api-key_ben@ecoquants.com.txt\"\nproject_name <- \"iea-auto\"\n\n# use API key to authenticate\nCLOCKIFY_API_KEY <- readLines(api_txt)\nset_api_key(CLOCKIFY_API_KEY)\n\n# get data\nd_projects <- projects() %>% \n      select(project_id, project_name)\nd_users <- users() %>% \n      select(user_id, user_name)\nd_times <- time_entries(concise = F) %>% \n  left_join(\n    d_projects, by = \"project_id\") %>% \n  left_join(\n    d_users, by = \"user_id\")\n\n# show table\nd_times %>% \n  select(\n    user_name, project_name, \n    time_start, duration, description) %>% \n  arrange(user_name, project_name, time_start) %>% \n  datatable() %>%\n  formatRound(columns=c('duration'), digits=3)\n\n\n\nKnit the document to create index.html, the default web page served for any given folder. The rendered output table should look something like this:\n\n4.5 Setup Github Pages for your Repo\nSetup your Github repo to serve the newly generated index.html choosing the root folder, per Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site - GitHub Docs.\n\nCopy the published website URL and paste into the Repository’s About settings after clicking the Gear icon in upper right of your main Github repo website.\n5 Continue Tracking Time on your Project\nContinue tracking time as you work on your Remote Sensing group projects. Be sure to choose a Task. Later we’ll subdivide your initial Tasks into Github Issues and track time specific to those.\nNext lab we’ll start into using Github by creating a Github organization where you’ll report time for the whole project. We’ll also setup a Github Action to generate a table and charts on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly.\n6 Submit Lab via Form\nPlease submit the link to the Clockify project report and your personal time tracking website on Github via the following Google Form using your UCSB email:\nSubmission for Lab 2.
