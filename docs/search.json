In this class you’ll learn how to work together on code while managing a project. You’ll apply these techniques to the group project from the course Remote Sensing (EDS 220) and they should help you manage your Capstone group project starting winter quarter. The techniques will help guide three basic questions:\nWhat should I work on next?\nHow long will it take?\nHow do we adapt to change?\nThese basic questions are however deceptively difficult to answer, especially as the size of the team and scope of the project increases.\nWhat should I work on next? You’ll learn ‘agile’ software development techniques to divide work into tasks, which can be assigned to various team members and passed between as work progresses. These tasks can be arranged as cards into columns on a ‘Kanban’ board: horizontally according to status (ToDo, In Progress, Done) or time (next week, next month, …); and vertically based on priority (from most to least important, top to bottom). This overview of who is to do what next will be approached with different tools embracing increasing levels of complexity: a Trello board for basic projects without code, a Github Project to integrate Github Issues associated with code level git commit messages, and ZenHub for adding dependencies between issues and clustering into Epics for use with Roadmaps.\nHow long will it take? You’ll take on the role of an environmental data science consultancy responding to a request for proposal. In the proposal you’ll outline milestones with deliverables and associated dollar amounts based on time estimates and hourly rates of team members. You’ll track time spent on each task and report out at the end with a presentation on time spent over and under expectations, which will help update your understanding for future estimates. You’ll use Clockify to track time and Rmarkdown to generate reports.\nHow do we adapt to change? Changes are inevitable with technical problem solving and client requirements. As Mark Zuckerberg famously said “move fast and break things.” Iterating quickly within the team and getting feedback from all stakeholders are an important part of the development process and the basis for ‘agile’ project management. You’ll compare ‘traditional’ project management with scoping tasks at the outset of the project with a Gantt chart as a ‘waterfall’ diagram showing various phases of the project (eg data collection, analysis and communication). As you proceed with the project you’ll keep track of tasks that expand and shift with some evaluation after the fact through a burndown report. Other ‘agile’ techniques and roles will be reviewed to adapt to change.\n3 Grading\nGrades will be based on the following percentages:\nAttendance: 10%\nLabs: 60%\nPresentation: 30%\n4 Readings\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1: Bennett and Gadlin (2012) (pdf)\nWeek 2: Lowndes et al.

Use Google Docs to keep quick flexible notes as you proceed with meetings using headers and table of contents.\nTasks. Break down your project into tasks.\nSchedule of Tasks. Create a simple schedule in Google Sheets using cells as units of time. Create a detailed Google Chart pulling from specific dates in a Google Sheet.\nSchedule of Deliverables. Create a table of deliverables with due date and amount based on schedule of tasks, estimated hours and an hourly rate.\nRFP and Proposal. Write a simple Request for Proposal and a responding Proposal with core elements for submission.\n2 Create Group Project Key and Title\n\nThere are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.\n— Phil Karlton (Netscape “Principal Curmudgeon”; 1947-1997)\n\nThink carefully about what you’d like to call your group project. Come up with:\nTitle\ncamel case, with spaces\nFor instance, “Ocean Health Index.”\nKey\nall lower case, no spaces, possibly an acronym\nFor instance, “ohi.” Ideally, find a key that is not already taken on Github. Since github.com/ohi is already taken, we chose “ohi-science” as the final key.\n3 Take Notes in Google Docs\nHave one of your project members create a folder named after the project’s key name in Google Drive. Share this folder with all members and the instructor (ben@ecoquants.com).\nAdd a Google Document named “notes | {key}” (swapping out {key} with your project’s Key). (Note that adding the extra project key to the document name makes it show up in the browser tab, which differentiates it from other tabs with documents named simply “notes.”) Add the same name to the top of the document formatted as Title. Add Meetings formatted as Heading 1 and below that today’s date in YYYY-MM-DD format as Heading 2. Between the title and first header add normal text “Contents:” and below that add Table of Contents. For reference, see: Add a title, heading, or table of contents in a document - Computer - Docs Editors Help. Start the first bullet point. Your document should look similar to this:\n4 Consider Tasks of your Project\nNow consider the various Tasks of your project, such as: data acquisition, information extraction and cleaning, data integration, modeling, analysis, interpretation and deployment (Larson (2019)). Try to be as specific as you can. Write these down in your notes as a numbered list.\nData science workflow showing Tasks of development with iteration. Source: Wickham and Grolemund (2017)5 Create Simple Project Schedule\nYour first Gantt chart will simply use cells horizontally as time.\nCreate a new Google Sheet in your project Drive folder named “schedule | {key}” (swapping out {key} with your project’s Key). Name the tab “simple.”\nAdd columns “Task,” dates “Nov 1,” “Nov 8.” Select “Nov 1” and “Nov 8” cells, then click the lower right blue box to drag and fill values to the end of the quarter, “Dec 6.”\nFill out the Tasks column with those specific to your project.\nMake the cell background gray for the estimated work period for each of the Tasks, whereby the start day is given by the column’s date.\nMake the column headers bold and add border lines below the header and to the right of the Task column.\nYou simple Gantt chart should look similar to this:\n\n6 Create Detailed Project Schedule\nFor more complex projects, you might want to display the project schedule with specific dates over time. To do this you’ll create a Google Chart from Task data using dates.\nCreate a new tab called “detailed” in the same “schedule | {key}” Google Sheet. Copy the “Task” column from your “simple” tab to this new one.\nAdd columns “Start Date” and “End Date.” Fill out these dates per Task.\nAdd columns “Start Day” and “Duration.” Calculate the first of these fields according to the dates and fill down values for all Tasks:\nStart Day: =int(B2)-int($B$2). This represents the number of days from the beginning of the project $B$2 that the task starts. Notice how the dollar prefixes for cell $B$2 continue to use the same fixed cell as values get filled down (vs B2 changing to C2, D2, etc.).\nDuration: =int(C2)-int(B2). This represents the number of days for each task.\n\nMove “Start Date” and “End Date” columns to the right of “Start Day” and “Duration.”\nSelect all cells within the “Task,” “Start Day” and “Duration” columns including the headers. From the menu, choose Insert -> Chart. It will default to a “Stacked bar chart.”\nConfigure the chart. In the Chart editor panel on the right, click the Customize tab. Click Series, then click the dropdown menu and Start Day. Enter 0% for Fill opacity to turn off display of this Series. The chart should now resemble a Gantt chart.\nUpdate the Chart and Axis Titles. Double-click on the title at the top of the chart. Type new title “Project Schedule.” Customize the Chart & axis titles so the Horizontal axis title has “Day” for Title text.\nRemove the Chart Legend. Click on the chart and three circles in upper right, Edit chart. Click the Customize tab in the Chart editor panel, then click Legend. Select Position: None.\n\nIcons made by Smashicons from www.flaticon.com\n\nIn the end, you should have a chart like so:\n\n7 Create Schedule of Deliverables\nCreate a new tab called “deliverables” in your “schedule | {key}” Google Sheet.\nAdd columns: Deliverable | Date Due | Amount | Hours | Hourly Rate. Make the first 3 column headers (Deliverable | Date Due | Amount) bold and add an underline to be used in the final table, whereas the Hours and Hourly Rate columns are only used to calculate the Amount.\nPopulate the Deliverables and Date Due cells base on outputs from the schedule of Tasks.\nEnter the Hourly Rate of $100 and estimate the number of hours it will take to complete each task here described as deliverables.\nEnter the first cell for the Amount using the equation =D2*$E$2 and fill down:\n8 Write the RFP\nCreate a Google Documents simple named after RFP (Request for proposal) with your project key, so “rfp | {key}.” Give it a title summarizing the desired output product and a new line below that with “Request for Proposal” formatted as a Subtitle. Imagine you are the client seeking the analytic output of your Remote Sensing group project. Write one paragraph describing this as a request to solicit bids from environmental data science consultancies.\n9 Write the Proposal\nCreate a Google Document named “proposal | {key}.” This is your environmental data science consultancy’s response to the RFP bidding for the work.\nInclude in your proposal:\nTitle same as RFP with subtitle Proposal.\nDate in the upper right.\nContents with Table of Contents added, similar to Notes.\nOverview. Below a Heading 1 of Overview, describe the project summarizing or expanding upon the RFP in a paragraph.\nSchedule of Deliverables. Paste your schedule of deliverables below a Heading 1 of “Schedule of Deliverables.”\nWork Schedule. Include a detailed chart below a Heading 1 of “Work Schedule.” Optional: Expand on each of the tasks with more details in paragraph form below the chart.\nTeam. Below a Heading 1 of Team, provide a bulleted list of each team member with First Last (UCSB email address) and a one sentence description of relevant experience. Provide the rate for each team member as $100/hour.\n10 Submit Lab via Form\nEvery team member must submit links to the lab outputs via the following Google Form using your UCSB email:\nSubmission for Lab 1.
